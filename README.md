Overall
Beginning in spring 2009, a pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, colloquially named "swine flu," swept across the world. Researchers estimate that in the first year, it was responsible for between 151,000 to 575,000 deaths globally.A vaccine for the H1N1 flu virus became publicly available in October 2009. In late 2009 and early 2010, the United States conducted the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. This phone survey asked respondents whether they had received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with questions about themselves. These additional questions covered their social, economic, and demographic background, opinions on risks of illness and vaccine effectiveness, and behaviors towards mitigating transmission. A better understanding of how these characteristics are associated with personal vaccination patterns can provide guidance for future public health efforts.In this project, we will take a look at vaccination, a key public health measure used to fight infectious diseases. Vaccines provide immunization for individuals, and enough immunization in a community can further reduce the spread of diseases through "herd immunity."Influenza virus vaccine, H1N1 is used to prevent infection caused by the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus. The vaccine works by causing your body to produce its own protection (antibodies) against the disease. It is also known as a "flu shot".
